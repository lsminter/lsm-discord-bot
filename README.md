# Mint Tea
This is my custom bot for the Old School RuneScape clan Tea. It's handles very few things right now but it's mostly just a fun project for me to learn how to create a Discord bot. 

I currently have no real direction for the bot. Just adding in commands as people suggest them. In the future I'll probably end up really cleaning this up and organizing everything but for now, since it's pretty small, I'll just keep it as is. 

## Commands

Commands start with a `!`. 

`!allcommands` will list all of the commands. 

`!eventhelp` will show you how to run the `!event` command. 

`!event` will have the bot message the user in a private dm with quests for the following: the event_name, the number of people wanted for the event, how long until the event starts, and if there are any requirements for the event. 

`!eventstats` has the bot reply to the user with the WiseOldMan stats for the top three players in the most recent competition.  

`!userstats` will search for the users' currently gained experience for the most recent WiseOldMan competition. 

## Deployment

This bot is being deployed by Heroku.
