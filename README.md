This is my first test at creating a discord bot.

Push to github: `git push`
Push to Heroku: `git push heroku main`

# Mint Tea
This is the bot for the Old School RuneScape clan Tea. It's handles very few things right now but it's mostly just a fun project for me to learn how to create a Discord bot. 

I currently have no real direction for the bot. Just adding in commands as people suggest them. In the future I'll probably end up really cleaning this up and organizing everything but for now, since it's pretty small, I'll just keep it as is. 

## Commands

Commands start with a `!`. 

`!commands` will list all of the commands. 

`!eventhelp` will show you how to run the `!event` command. 

`!event` has the bot reply to the user's message with the event_name, the number of people wanted for the event, and how long until the event starts. 

`!eventstats` has the bot reply to the user with the WiseOldMan stats for the top three players in the most recent competition.
